        At Bridge Bright Center, our Behavioral Therapy program is designed to
        support children in overcoming emotional and behavioral challenges that
        may impact their well-being, relationships, and daily functioning. Our
        approach is rooted in compassion and expertise, focusing on empowering
        children to develop positive coping strategies, emotional regulation
        skills, and healthier behaviors.
      </p>
        <h2 className={styles.section_header}>Our Approach</h2>
        <p className={styles.section_paragraph}>
          We understand that every child is unique, so our behavioral therapy
          plans are personalized to meet the individual needs and circumstances
          of each child. Our skilled therapists use evidence-based practices,
          including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Applied Behavior
          Analysis (ABA), and other integrative techniques to address specific
          behavioral concerns. Sessions are conducted in a safe, supportive
          environment where children feel comfortable expressing their emotions
          and thoughts.
          <br /> <br />
          We work collaboratively with families to ensure consistent support
          both at the center and at home. By involving parents and caregivers,
          we help create a holistic support system that reinforces positive
          changes. Our therapists also coordinate with educators and other
          professionals to ensure the childâ€™s progress is continuous and
          well-integrated across various environments
        </p>
